# epg-ui

The epg-ui is an extremely simple static website that is used for emulating an EPG for demo purposes. It provides a mock EPG where users can click elements. Some lightweight JavaScript then calls the **epg-ui** to fetch an URL for the synthesised audio, which is then played back to the user.
